      %h2 Don't Break the Chain
      %p Spend any amount of time doing a desired activity every day and, when you do, mark off that day on DBTC. This creates a chain showing your progress. If you don't do your activity one day, you don't get an X and your chain is broken. Your chain is your motivation to keep going. It seems too simple, but it works!
